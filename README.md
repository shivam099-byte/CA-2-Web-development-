The Personal Student Portfolio Website is a simple, multi-page web development project created using only HTML and basic CSS.
The main purpose of this project is to build an online presence where a student can showcase personal details, skills, academic
background, and ways to be contacted. The website is designed to be clean, easy to navigate, and beginner-friendly.

The project contains four separate HTML pages, each serving a specific purpose:

1. (index.html)

The homepage introduces the visitor to the website. It typically includes a welcome message, a brief introduction 
of the student, and basic navigation links to other pages.

 2. (about.html)

This page presents detailed personal information about the student. It includes background details such as
education, interests, goals, and achievements. The purpose is to give visitors a clear understanding of who the student is.

 3.  (skills.html)

This section highlights the student’s technical and soft skills. It can also showcase academic or personal projects
with descriptions. The page helps visitors understand what the student is capable of and what technologies they have experience with.

 4.  (contact.html)

The contact page provides a simple HTML form where visitors can input their name, email, and message. This allows potential 
instructors, collaborators, or employers to reach out.

 Project Aim

The aim of this project is to demonstrate foundational web development skills by creating a structured and visually
appealing portfolio using only HTML and CSS. It helps students learn about webpage structuring, styling, linking pages,
and designing user-friendly layouts.
